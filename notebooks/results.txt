The Ram was not secured inside,it was tumbling all over the place and could've been damaged.For Very Long time I've been looking for a RAM upgrade for my Lenovo Legion 5 Pro which was purchased in 2021 with Ryzebn 5800H RTX3060 graphics with 16GB Preinstalled (Pathetic Rx16) memory. Basically in 2023 the 16GB Ram is too low for a high end Laptop like this. I have purchased two 16GB Ram sticks and eventually got Dual Rank Rx8 Ram which i was looking for so Long. If your are planning to buy 16GB Dual Rank then Choose only Appario Retail Seller they are giving dual rank ram which is way better than Single Rank. Don't go with third party sellers. Preinstalled RAM bottlenecks your Laptop."
